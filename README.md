 Twitter Cyberbullying Detection Using machine learning techniques

# Description

This project aims to address the critical issue of cyberbullying on the Twitter platform through the application of machine learning techniques. Cyberbullying is a pervasive problem affecting individuals across the globe, and this project seeks to contribute to the creation of a safer online environment.#1.Problem statement:

As social media continues to expand, providing a platform for communication and connection, it has concurrently given rise to the pressing concern of cyberbullying. This persistent issue disproportionately affects young users, posing serious consequences. Current text-based detection methods exhibit limitations, struggling to grasp the subtleties of online aggression and harassment. Consequently, a substantial number of victims remain vulnerable to the harmful impacts of cyberbullying, ranging from emotional distress to academic challenges and, in severe cases, self-harm.

#Problem Overview

Our objective is to create a resilient and effective machine learning model that autonomously identifies instances of cyberbullying on the Twitter platform. Going beyond conventional text-based methods, our strategy integrates word similarity analysis with traditional machine learning techniques to overcome limitations. This dual approach allows us to uncover nuanced forms of aggression, resulting in a robust model proficient in accurately discerning bullying tweets from non-bullying content.

#Machine learning model training and evaluation:

In our endeavor to combat the rising prevalence of cyberbullying on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, we adopt a robust machine learning approach. To effectively address the evolving challenges posed by cyberbullying, we deploy a combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes classifiers. This strategic choice stems from the imperative need for a potent amalgamation of traditional machine learning techniques and nuanced word similarity analysis to discern subtle forms of aggression in tweets. The implementation marks a noteworthy advancement in automating the detection and prevention of cyberbullying on Twitter.

In the evaluation phase, our results showcase a noteworthy achievement: SVM outperforms Naïve Bayes. This revelation underscores the effectiveness of our SVM-based approach in detecting true positives, contributing significantly to the ongoing efforts aimed at developing efficient tools for identifying and mitigating cyberbullying on social media. Our ultimate goal is to foster a safer online environment by leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
